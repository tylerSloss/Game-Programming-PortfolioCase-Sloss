Summary: The portfolio is overall well designed, but can feel overwhelming with the amount of information being shown and amount of text. 
What is good: The sidebar allows for a more focused feel even with so much going on. There aremany links throughout to allow for more detail. His contacts are easy to find and don't take up too much space where something else would be. 
What needs more work: There are a lot of accomplishments to his name, but this makes the whole thing feel cluttered with words, and could be overwhelming at times. 
Why I would hire this person: With many experiences under his belt, there is no doubt that he would make a great asset to any game development team. He has a willingness to learn and is very detailed in his work.
